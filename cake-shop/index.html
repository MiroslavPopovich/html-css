                        <p>
                            The history of cake dates back to ancient times. The
                            first cakes were very different from what we eat
                            today. They were more bread-like and sweetened with
                            honey. Nuts and dried fruits were often added.
                            According to the food historians, the ancient
                            Egyptians were the first culture to show evidence of
                            advanced baking skills. The Oxford English
                            Dictionary traces the English word cake back to the
                            13th century. It is a derivation of 'kaka', an Old
                            Norse word. Medieval European bakers often made
                            fruitcakes and gingerbread. These foods could last
                            for many months.

                        <p>
                            According to the food historians, the precursors of
                            modern cakes (round ones with icing) were first
                            baked in Europe sometime in the mid-17th century.
                            This is due to primarily to advances in technology
                            (more reliable ovens, manufacture/availability of
                            food molds) and ingredient availability (refined
                            sugar). At that time cake hoops--round molds for
                            shaping cakes that were placed on flat baking
                            trays--were popular. They could be made of metal,
                            wood or paper. Some were adjustable. Cake pans were
                            sometimes used. The first icing were usually a
                            boiled composition of the finest available sugar,
                            egg whites and [sometimes] flavorings. This icing
                            was poured on the cake. The cake was then returned
                            to the oven for a while. When removed the icing
                            cooled quickly to form a hard, glossy [ice-like]
                            covering. Many cakes made at this time still
                            contained dried fruits (raisins, currants, citrons).

                            It was not until the middle of the 19th century that
                            cake as we know it today (made with extra refined
                            white flour and baking powder instead of yeast)
                            arrived on the scene. A brief history of baking
                            powder. The Cassell's New Universal Cookery Book
                            [London, <time datetime="1894">1894</time>] contains
                            a recipe for layer cake, American (p.

                            [powdered] sugar and flavorings) began replacing
